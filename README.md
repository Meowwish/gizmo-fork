# gizmo-slug

## workarounds for compiler and MPI bugs
* Clang is the recommended compiler. Intel compiler version 2020.3.304 is tested and also works. (Earlier Intel versions sometimes fail to work correctly with SLUG and/or GIZMO.) GCC also mostly works (but do *not* use GCC version 7, it will generate incorrect code that will crash).
* `NO_ISEND_IRECV_IN_DOMAIN` should *always* be enabled; otherwise the code will randomly hang in an MPI call during the domain decomposition
* Disable FITS and MPI support while building SLUG. Use `make lib` instead of `make` because SLUG is only needed as a library. Before running GIZMO (e.g., using a `pbs` script), you have to explicitly set the environment variable `SLUG_DIR='/absolute/path/to/slug'` otherwise gizmo cannot locate slug.
* `USE_MPI_IN_PLACE` should *almost always* be enabled (required if using OpenMPI); if it is not but it should be, the code will crash during MPI calls with aliased pointers
* *If you are using Mellanox Infiniband cards:* The Mellanox hardware-accelerated MPI collectives implementation has a bug that crashes the code. Workaround: add `-x HCOLL_ENABLE_MCAST=0` to the `mpirun` command-line options

## notes
* Download the grackle and slug submodules by using the command `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* This version of the code is only tested with the versions of Grackle and SLUG that are included as submodules. Use other versions at your own risk.
* Enabling SLUG adds a ~20% memory overhead to the particle data allocations but should have ~5% runtime overhead for production resolution runs.
* When SLUG is enabled, it is recommended to use 0+1+1024 for the star formation bitflags (and nothing else). Without adding +1024, collapse may continue to arbitrarily high densities (implying arbitrarily small timesteps in MFM mode).
* Even with the +1024 bitflag, a very small number of gas particles may still have extremely high densities. This appears to be due to some gas particles gaining mass (via SN ejecta) and becoming bound to one or more neighbouring particles. However, timesteps for these particles are not updated immediately (since particles only have their timesteps updated when their *previous* timestep ends) and they are therefore not immediately turned into star particles. Ideally, particles that have their mass/momentum/energy changed would have their timesteps recalculated immediately following the feedback injection, but this is not implemented.
* `GALSF_SFR_MOLECULAR_CRITERION` is not compatible with Grackle cooling. Don't try to use it with Grackle.
* The SLUG functionality has not been tested with cosmological simulations. It may not work or may even give incorrect results.
* The SLUG functionality has not been tested with OpenMP. It may not work or may even given incorrect results.
* In MFM mode, `MinGasHsmlFractional` *must* be set to exactly zero. Otherwise, a numerical instability may occur that causes the simulation to explode.
* The photoionization feedback has been re-implemented following the description in the FIRE-2 'Physics Versus Numerics' paper. Also, I have added a limit for the maximum radius of an HII region, which is necessary in order for SLUG feedback to work properly, since the feedback is much more clustered when SLUG is enabled.
* The fiducial radial momentum used by GIZMO for SN feedback is 679,000 Msun km/s. This is 2.26 times greater than the commonly-used estimate from Thornton et al. (1998) (3e5 Msun km/s). There was a particle configuration-dependent normalization bug in the injected mass, momentum, and energy, leading to a factor ~2 overestimate in the worst case. In this version of the code, I have adjusted the fiducial value to match that of Thornton et al., and also fixed the normalization (the latter is now fixed in Phil's bitbucket repository).
* `STOP_WHEN_BELOW_MINTIMESTEP` is always recommended (to avoid burning through a compute allocation due to infinitesimal timesteps as a result of a misconfiguration or some other problem)
* If possible, restart only from restartfiles; in earlier versions of the code, restarting from snapshot files sometimes causes temperatures to blow up (cause unknown); if you must restart from a snapshot, create a new parameter file and set ICFile to be the snapshot
* Restarting from restartfiles is likely to fail if any parameters in the parameter file or compile-time options are changed.
* The cooling function included in GIZMO (in `cooling.c`) is incorrect for temperatures below 10^4 K, since diffuse Galactic ionizing sources are not included. It does not have an unstable phase at the correct density between WNM/CNM. Use Grackle instead.
* yt does not compute the temperature from GIZMO snapshots correctly. Use the pseudocode given in the GIZMO User's Guide to compute the temperature instead.

## original readme
This is **GIZMO**: a flexible, multi-method multi-physics code. The code solves the fluid using Lagrangian mesh-free finite-volume Godunov methods (or SPH, or fixed-grid Eulerian methods), and self-gravity with fast hybrid PM-Tree methods and fully-adaptive resolution. Other physics include: magnetic fields (ideal and non-ideal), radiation-hydrodynamics, anisotropic conduction and viscosity, sub-grid turbulent diffusion, radiative cooling, cosmological integration, sink particles, dust-gas mixtures, cosmic rays, degenerate equations of state, galaxy/star/black hole formation and feedback, self-interacting and scalar-field dark matter, on-the-fly structure finding, and more. 

See the [User Guide](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO_files/gizmo_documentation.html) for an up-to-date physics list, or [the original code website](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html) for examples demonstrating the advantages of the new methods, different types of **GIZMO** simulations, and its massively-parallel scalings.

The code is descended from P-SPH, itself descended from GADGET-3 (so a huge debt owes to the work of Volker Springel), and many of the GADGET conventions remain (for compatibility with GADGET outputs and codes). See the source code for appropriate attribution of the code elements. 

Both the [public code](https://bitbucket.org/phopkins/gizmo-public) and the [development (private) code](https://bitbucket.org/phopkins/gizmo) are hosted on Bitbucket version-controlled repositories, but for code issues, feature requests, or bugs, please post to the [GIZMO Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/gizmo-code).

Basic Rules: 

1. The reference for code methods, setup, use and citation policy is the User Guide, available as `gizmo_documentation.html` in the `scripts` folder as part of this repository, or via download [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO_files/gizmo_documentation.html). Read it! The code is extensively documented. Important things you need to know before running are there. Most questions are already answered.  

2. Access to the development (private) code does **not** imply permission to use any modules identified as proprietary either in the User Guide or `Template_Config.sh` file (or elsewhere). The development code can only be used or distributed with explicit permission from the code authors. Many of the non-public modules are proprietary and developed by students for on-going research; it is not acceptable to use or share these routines without first obtaining the explicit permission of both the lead code author and author(s) of the relevant routines. If in doubt, ask. Anyone violating these terms will have code access immediately revoked.

The public version of the code is free software, distributed under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). You may freely distribute and copy the public code. You may also modify it as you wish, and distribute these modified versions as long as you indicate prominently any changes you made in the original code, and as long as you leave the copyright notices, and the no-warranty notice intact. Please read the General Public License for more details. Note that the authors retain their copyright on the code. 

If you use any version of the code, please reference the code paper, [Hopkins 2015, MNRAS, 450, 53](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7395); you should also reference Volker Springel's GADGET paper (Springel, 2005, MNRAS, 364, 1105) for the domain decomposition and N-body algorithms. Appropriate citations for specific modules are described in the Users Guide.
